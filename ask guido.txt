1 -> is there anyway to diferentiate between

	if (x < 10)
		a = a + 1;
	else
		b = b + 1;

and 

	if (x < 10) {
		a = a + 1;
	} else {
		b = b + 1;
	}

in such a way that if a brace exists the automatic indentation is different.
As I see there are two ways, either I always force braces to exist (as defined by K&R style indentation) or I create a new sort Block which is not a Statement anymore (to avoid ambiguation)


2 -> I am defining functions in such a way that autocomplete imediately returns the following 
int FuncName (Arguments)
{
	Variable Declaration

	Body

	return Return value;
}

however if i pretty print already existing code that is missing some of the optional sorts I will have an extra newline there. For example if it is missing the body?

int foo ()
{
	int a;


	return 0;
}

Is there a way I can put an optional newline in case the sort is used? An alternative would be to add \\n to the label but in that case the new line is also replaced by the user.
