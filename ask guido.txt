the follwing should succeed right as syntaxically is correcy? 

	test semantically invalid struct [[a.(1)]] parse succeeds // syntax correct, semantics incorrect
	test semantically invalid struct [[x.(a)]] parse succeeds // syntax correct, semantics incorrect
	test semantically invalid struct [[x.(a + b)]] parse succeeds // syntax correct, semantics incorrect
	test semantically invalid struct [[p.1]] parse succeeds // syntax correct, semantics incorrect


the following should have a ";" after return Exp right?
FunctionDec = Type ID "(" FormalList ")" "{" VarDec* Statement* "return" Exp "}"

the following should have a ";" at the end right?
TypeDec   = "struct" ID "{" VarDec* "}"

why does program has a Exp at the end?
Program   = TypeDec* VarDec* FunctionDec* Exp
