how should I handle ifs and elses in the test cases? Since there is no bool is C?

should i consider forward resolution? ("normal" C does not allow it)

should i allow polymorphism?
i am assuming if/while/&&/! can only by used with logical expressions and not literals, is this correct?

// is returning float insteads of int (and vice versa) considered error or warning?
