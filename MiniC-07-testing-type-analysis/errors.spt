// A type error occurs, when the type of an expression does not conform to its expected type.
// Consider the following test case as an example:

// In MiniJava, System.out.println() can only print integers.
// Thus, there should be an error on true, when we pass it to the print statement.
// Similarly, type errors can occur in other statements, expressions,
// and method declarations. You should come up with test cases for such errors.
// Again, keep in mind that coverage is the main criterion for your grade.
