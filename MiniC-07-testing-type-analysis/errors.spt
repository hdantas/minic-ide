// %% Method errors %%
// You should also come up with test cases for error checking on method names.
// This should include test cases for errors on duplicate definitions,
// missing definitions, and method overloading as well as for notes
// on method overriding. Similar to previous test cases,
// you can pair up positive (0 errors) and negative test cases.

// %% Type errors %% 
// A type error occurs, when the type of an expression does not conform to its expected type.
// Consider the following test case as an example:

// In MiniJava, System.out.println() can only print integers.
// Thus, there should be an error on true, when we pass it to the print statement.
// Similarly, type errors can occur in other statements, expressions,
// and method declarations. You should come up with test cases for such errors.
// Again, keep in mind that coverage is the main criterion for your grade.
