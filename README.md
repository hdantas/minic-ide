This repository contains a IDE for miniC, a subset of the C language (for more information check the grammar in ```MiniC grammar.txt```). The compiler is built on top of the Spoofax Language Workbench (<a href="http://metaborg.org/spoofax/">metaborg.org/spoofax</a>). With respect to the structure, the project is divided in individual assignment that together form three major milestones:

<ol>
<li>MiniC editor (syntax analysis, pretty-printing, code templates, syntax highlighting, outline view)</li>
<li>MiniC analyser (name analysis, type analysis, constraint checking, code completion)</li>
<li>MiniC compiler (Java bytecode generation)</li>
</ol>

The ```MiniC/``` directory contains the complete IDE while the numbered directories include the changes between the individual assignments.

This project was done for TU Delft course: Compiler Construction (ET4303).
