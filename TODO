DAY 4

Specify rewrite rules to-outline-label which map AST nodes to labels in an outline view. You should include:
  // classes (class name and, if available, parent class name),
  // fields (field name and type),
  // methods (method name, parameter types, return type) and
  // local variables (variable name and type).
  Challenge

Define rewrite rules desugar which desugar
  unary expressions into terms of the form Uop(op, exp),
  binary expressions into terms of the form Bop(op, exp1, exp2) and
  octal numbers into decimal numbers.

Integrate desugar into a strategy desugar-all which desugars subtrees in an AST.
