You can earn up to 75 points for the correctness of your name and type analysis. Therefor, we run several test cases against your implementation. You earn points, when your implementation passes test cases. The total number of points depends on how many test cases you pass in each of the following groups:

name binding (5 points)
	inheritance (5 points)
subtyping (25 points)
	parent types (15 points)
	ancestor types (10 points)
constraints (40 points)
	hiding variables and fields (5 points)
	method overloading and method overriding (20 points)
	cyclic inheritance (10 points)
	subtyping in assignments, return expressions, method calls (5 points)
challenge (using TS) (5 points)

You can earn up to 10 points for your messages in errors and warnings. We particular focus on readibility, precision, and the level of detail in your messages.

Finally, you can earn up to 5 points for the organisation of your NaBL, TS and Stratego files and up to 10 points for the quality of your code. We focus on readibility in general, meaningful variable names and the consistent use of NaBL Stratego paragdims. We will consider the fact that these languages are new to you.
