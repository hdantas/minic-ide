Develop a test suite for type analysis. The test suite should provide

1. Test cases for the types of expressions.
2. Test cases for the resolution of method names.
3. Test cases for
	errors on duplicate method definitions,
	errors on missing method definitions,
	errors on overloaded methods,
	notes on overriding methods,
	type errors in expressions,
	type errors in statements, and
	type errors in method definitions.


How should I handle ifs and elses in the type analysis test cases since there is no bool is C?

They require integers, right? You can check for this.

Should I force forward declarations exist? (such as in "normal" C)

Yes.

Is method overloading permitted?

Assume it is allowed.

In addition when can we meet for grading of the previous assignments?
I prefer at the beginning (8/8.30) or at the end (17.30/18) of the day, any weekday but Friday. Currently I am working on my thesis in a company and therefore my availability is unfortunately more restricted.
