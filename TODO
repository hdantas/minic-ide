Develop a test suite for type analysis. The test suite should provide

1. Test cases for the types of expressions.
2. Test cases for the resolution of method names.
3. Test cases for
	errors on duplicate method definitions,
	errors on missing method definitions,
	errors on overloaded methods,
	notes on overriding methods,
	type errors in expressions,
	type errors in statements, and
	type errors in method definitions.
