DAY 12

	You can earn up to 25 points for your example MiniJava programs and their corresponding Jasmin programs. We will focus on completeness and correctness of your examples. Furthermore, you can earn up to 65 points for your code generator:

	transformation (55 points)
		types (5 points)
		fields (10 points)
		methods (15 points)
		variables (10 points)
		assignments (15 points)
	challenges (10 points)
		reusable field descriptors (2 points)
		reusable variable accessors (2 points)
		debug information (6 points)

	You can earn up to 5 points for the organisation of your Stratego files and up to 5 points for the quality of your code. We focus on readibility in general, meaningful variable names and the consistent use of Stratego paragdims. We will consider the fact that Stratego is new to you.

	In this assignment, we also give you the chance to earn up to 10 bonus points. This works like a challenge, but it gives you extra points on top of the total points of your assignment.


	TODO
		make sure i can access array fields
