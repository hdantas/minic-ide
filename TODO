DAY 4

Specify rewrite rules to-outline-label which map AST nodes to labels in an outline view. You should include:
  // classes (class name and, if available, parent class name),
  // fields (field name and type),
  // methods (method name, parameter types, return type) and
  // local variables (variable name and type).
  Challenge
    1.Provide the file name as the root node label. See lib/runtime/editor/origins/ for a suitable strategy.
    2.Outline the main method as a subnode of the main class.
      This requires you to drop the import editor/MiniJava-Outliner.generated.
      Instead, you need tp define a strategy outline = custom-label-outline(to-outline-label, to-outline-node)
      Visit lib/runtime/editor/outline-library for inspiration.

Define rewrite rules desugar which desugar
  // unary expressions into terms of the form UnOp(op, exp),
  // binary expressions into terms of the form BinOp(op, exp1, exp2) and
  Choose one of the desugar-all strategies
  Challenge: octal numbers into decimal numbers.

Integrate desugar into a strategy desugar-all which desugars subtrees in an AST.
